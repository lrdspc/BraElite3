   - Create detailed specifications
   - Design UI mockups where applicable
   - Define acceptance criteria

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Develop code changes
   - Create or update tests
   - Document changes

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Verify functionality
   - Test edge cases
   - Ensure offline capabilities work

4. **Documentation Phase**
